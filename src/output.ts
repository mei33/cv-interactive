FRONTEND DEVELOPER

${contacts}

I am a frontend web developer with main stack of React and TypeScript, but I have experience working with other technologies. Currently I work in one of the largest social networking services in the world — VK.com as a frontend developer in the e-commerce department. Previously I worked in a fully remote company headquartered in Singapore, CSSSR, which specialises in modern stack and solves the problems of fintech corporations.

2020 - Present
Senior frontend developer in the e-commerce department
React · TypeScript · PHP · KPHP · Unit testing · Storybook
Brought out of the ‘legacy’ state codebase of my own department for the whole platform: hastened migration to JSX and Typescript, covered business logic with tests, refactored backend on the principles of modularity, clarity and lucidity. I reorganised the process of a code review inside the department: code delivering became faster, team obtained psychological comfort despite change requests for a clear and scalable code. I initiated new strict standards and agreements in code writing for the whole company and was an active participant of elaborating them. I like to be the first who can do things that were postponed by others and encourage others to do those things with me - refactoring old code, reconsidering existing practises, creating tools (especially on hackathons) that could help each other to do work more efficiently. Now I solve business-tasks of department which helps small and medium business to find its clients, and the most important and interesting field for me is to write code related to analytics. As a side work I took a part as one of the main contributors in delivering dark theme to our site.

I wrote React code for web applications, which were involved in getting, processing and displaying data, which helped fintech companies to work effectively. I developed complex modular applications, which interacted with each other as libraries. I wrote a code myself and helped other teammates to do it. Also had a successful experience mentoring junior developers and students of our company's online course.
